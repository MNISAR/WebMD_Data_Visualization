# WebMD_Data_Visualization
Through the years, research and surveys have proven that the number of people using the Internet as a source of health information has only increased. The difficulty to find all information at one place has also been observed. Generally, people have to browse multiple websites to find the piece of information that they need, and get it verified from reliable sources. The goal of this project is to offer availability of reliable information at one venue, through visualizations that are much easier to understand and study, as compared to plain textual information. We aim to utilize the vast medical data available on the web to design an intelligent visual system that is capable of diagnosing diseases based on symptoms, and recommend medicines that have proven to be effective in similar cases, as per user reviews.
